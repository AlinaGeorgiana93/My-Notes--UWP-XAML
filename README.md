MyNotesApp â€“ A Modern Note-Taking Application

MyNotesApp is a sleek and user-friendly note-taking application built using [UWP / WinUI] technology. Designed with clean, soft pastel-themed interfaces, it supports both Light and Dark modes with automatic theme switching, providing a visually comfortable user experience.

Key features include:

Creating, editing, and deleting notes with rich text support.

Intuitive save functionality with a clearly styled Save button.

Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes.

A welcoming UI with pastel color schemes optimized for readability.

Support for emoji integration to personalize notes.

Seamless theme transitions respecting user preferences.

This app demonstrates my skills in modern desktop UI development, XAML styling, resource dictionaries for theme management, and event-driven programming in C#. It also showcases my attention to UX design and polish in UI elements.
